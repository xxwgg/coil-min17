See GIFs for more details. io.coil-kt:coil-svg : Includes a decoder to support decoding SVGs. See SVGs for more details. io.coil-kt:coil-video : Includes a decoder to support decoding frames from any of Android's supported video formats . See videos for more details. io.coil-kt:coil-bom : Includes a bill of materials . Importing coil-bom allows you to depend on other Coil artifacts without specifying a version. Image Loaders \u00b6 ImageLoader s are service classes that execute ImageRequest s. ImageLoader s handle caching, data fetching, image decoding, request management, bitmap pooling, memory management, and more. The default Coil artifact ( io.coil-kt:coil ) includes the singleton ImageLoader , which can be accessed using an extension function: context.imageLoader . The singleton ImageLoader can be configured by implementing ImageLoaderFactory on your Application class: class MyApplication : Application (), ImageLoaderFactory { override fun newImageLoader (): ImageLoader { return ImageLoader . Builder ( this ) . crossfade ( true ) . build () } } Implementing ImageLoaderFactory is optional. If you don't, Coil will lazily create an ImageLoader with the default values. Check out the full documentation for more info. Image Requests \u00b6 ImageRequest s are value classes that are executed by ImageLoader s. They describe where an image should be loaded from, how it should be loaded, and any extra parameters. An ImageLoader has two methods that can execute a request: enqueue : Enqueues the ImageRequest to be executed asynchronously on a background thread. execute : Executes the ImageRequest in the current coroutine and returns an ImageResult . All requests should set data (i.e. url, uri, file, drawable resource, etc.). This is what the ImageLoader will use to decide where to fetch the image data from. If you do not set data , it will default to NullRequestData . Additionally, you likely want to set a target when enqueuing a request. It's optional, but the target is what will receive the loaded placeholder/success/error drawables. Executed requests return an ImageResult which has the success/error drawable. Here's an example: // enqueue val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . target ( imageView ) . build () val disposable = imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) // execute val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . build () val result = imageLoader . execute ( request ) ImageView Extension Functions \u00b6 The io.coil-kt:coil artifact provides a set of ImageView extension functions. Here's an example for loading a URL into an ImageView : imageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) The above call is equivalent to: val imageLoader = imageView . context . imageLoader val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( imageView . context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . target ( imageView ) . build () imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) ImageView.load calls can be configured with an optional trailing lambda parameter: imageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) { crossfade ( true ) placeholder ( R . drawable . image ) transformations ( CircleCropTransformation ()) } See the docs here for more information. Supported Data Types \u00b6 The base data types that are supported by all ImageLoader instances are: String (mapped to a Uri) HttpUrl Uri ( android.resource , content , file , http , and https schemes) File @DrawableRes Int Drawable Bitmap ByteBuffer Supported Image Formats \u00b6 All ImageLoader s support the following non-animated file types: BMP JPEG PNG WebP HEIF (Android 8.0+) Additionally, Coil has extension libraries for the following file types: coil-gif : GIF, animated WebP (Android 9.0+), animated HEIF (Android 11.0+) coil-svg : SVG coil-video : Static video frames from any video codec supported by Android Preloading \u00b6 To preload an image into memory, enqueue or execute an ImageRequest without a Target : val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) // Optional, but setting a ViewSizeResolver will conserve memory by limiting the size the image should be preloaded into memory at. . size ( ViewSizeResolver ( imageView )) . build () imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) To preload a network image only into the disk cache, disable the memory cache for the request: val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . memoryCachePolicy ( CachePolicy . DISABLED ) . build () imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) Cancelling Requests \u00b6 ImageRequest s will be automatically cancelled in the following cases: request.lifecycle reaches the DESTROYED state. request.target is a ViewTarget and its View is detached. Additionally, ImageLoader.enqueue returns a Disposable , which can be used to dispose the request (which cancels it and frees its associated resources): val disposable = imageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) // Cancel the request. disposable . dispose ()","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#artifacts","text":"Coil has 8 artifacts published to mavenCentral() : io.coil-kt:coil : The default artifact which depends on io.coil-kt:coil-base , creates a singleton ImageLoader , and includes the ImageView extension functions. io.coil-kt:coil-base : A subset of io.coil-kt:coil which does not include the singleton ImageLoader and the ImageView extension functions. io.coil-kt:coil-compose : Includes support for Jetpack Compose . io.coil-kt:coil-compose-base : A subset of io.coil-kt:coil-compose which does not include functions that depend on the singleton ImageLoader . io.coil-kt:coil-gif : Includes two decoders to support decoding GIFs.

If you do that, depend on io.coil-kt:coil-base as that artifact doesn't create the singleton ImageLoader . Testing \u00b6 ImageLoader is an interface, which you can replace with a fake implementation. For instance, you could create a fake ImageLoader implementation which always returns the same Drawable synchronously: class FakeImageLoader ( private val context : Context ) : ImageLoader { override val defaults = DefaultRequestOptions () override val components = ComponentRegistry () override val memoryCache get () = null override val diskCache get () = null override fun enqueue ( request : ImageRequest ): Disposable { // Always call onStart before onSuccess. request . target ?. onStart ( request . placeholder ) val result = ColorDrawable ( Color .

Coil's image pipeline consists of five main parts that are executed in the following order: Interceptors , Mappers , Keyers , Fetchers , and Decoders . Custom components must be added to the ImageLoader when constructing it through its ComponentRegistry : val imageLoader = ImageLoader . Builder ( context ) . components { add ( CustomCacheInterceptor ()) add ( ItemMapper ()) add ( HttpUrlKeyer ()) add ( CronetFetcher . Factory ()) add ( GifDecoder . Factory ()) } . build () Interceptors \u00b6 Interceptors allow you to observe, transform, short circuit, or retry requests to an ImageLoader 's image engine. For example, you can add a custom cache layer like so: class CustomCacheInterceptor ( private val context : Context , private val cache : LruCache < String , Drawable > ) : Interceptor { override suspend fun intercept ( chain : Interceptor . Chain ): ImageResult { val value = cache . get ( chain . request . data . toString ()) if ( value != null ) { return SuccessResult ( drawable = value . bitmap . toDrawable ( context ), request = chain . request , dataSource = DataSource . MEMORY_CACHE ) } return chain . proceed ( chain . request ) } } Interceptors are an advanced feature that let you wrap an ImageLoader 's image pipeline with custom logic. Their design is heavily based on OkHttp's Interceptor interface . See Interceptor for more information. Mappers \u00b6 Mappers allow you to add support for custom data types. For instance, say we get this model from our server: data class Item ( val id : Int , val imageUrl : String , val price : Int , val weight : Double ) We could write a custom mapper to map it to its URL, which will be handled later in the pipeline: class ItemMapper : Mapper < Item , String > { override fun map ( data : Item , options : Options ) = data . imageUrl } After registering it when building our ImageLoader (see above), we can safely load an Item : val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( item ) . target ( imageView ) . build () imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) See Mapper for more information. Keyers \u00b6 Keyers convert data into a portion of a cache key. This value is used as MemoryCache.Key.key when/if this request's output is written to the MemoryCache . See Keyers for more information. Fetchers \u00b6 Fetchers translate data (e.g. URL, URI, File, etc.) into either an ImageSource or a Drawable . They typically convert the input data into a format that can then be consumed by a Decoder . Use this interface to add support for custom fetching mechanisms (e.g. Cronet, custom URI schemes, etc.) See Fetcher for more information. Decoders \u00b6 Decoders read an ImageSource and return a Drawable . Use this interface to add support for custom file formats (e.g. GIF, SVG, TIFF, etc.).

You might have to modify this code to fit your exact requirements, but it should hopefully give you a push in the right direction! See a common use case that isn't covered? Feel free to submit a PR with a new section. Palette \u00b6 Palette allows you to extract prominent colors from an image. To create a Palette , you'll need access to an image's Bitmap . This can be done in a number of ways: You can get access to an image's bitmap by setting a ImageRequest.Listener and enqueuing an ImageRequest : imageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) { // Disable hardware bitmaps as Palette needs to read the image's pixels. allowHardware ( false ) listener ( onSuccess = { _ , result -> // Create the palette on a background thread. Palette . Builder ( result . drawable . toBitmap ()). generate { palette -> // Consume the palette. } } ) } Using a custom OkHttpClient \u00b6 Coil uses OkHttp for all its networking operations. You can specify a custom OkHttpClient when creating your ImageLoader : val imageLoader = ImageLoader . Builder ( context ) // Create the OkHttpClient inside a lambda so it will be initialized lazily on a background thread. . okHttpClient { OkHttpClient . Builder () . addInterceptor ( CustomInterceptor ()) . build () } . build () Note If you already have a built OkHttpClient , use newBuilder() to build a new client that shares resources with the original. Headers \u00b6 Headers can be added to your image requests in one of two ways. You can set headers for a single request: val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . setHeader ( \"Cache-Control\" , \"max-age=31536000\" ) . target ( imageView ) . build () imageLoader . execute ( request ) Or you can create an OkHttp Interceptor that sets headers for every request executed by your ImageLoader : class ResponseHeaderInterceptor ( private val name : String , private val value : String ) : Interceptor { override fun intercept ( chain : Interceptor . Chain ): Response { val response = chain . proceed ( chain . request ()) return response . newBuilder (). header ( name , value ). build () } } val imageLoader = ImageLoader . Builder ( context ) . okHttpClient { OkHttpClient . Builder () // This header will be added to every image request. . addNetworkInterceptor ( ResponseHeaderInterceptor ( \"Cache-Control\" , \"max-age=31536000,public\" )) . build () } . build () Using a Memory Cache Key as a Placeholder \u00b6 Using a previous request's MemoryCache.Key as a placeholder for a subsequent request can be useful if the two images are the same, though loaded at different sizes. For instance, if the first request loads the image at 100x100 and the second request loads the image at 500x500, we can use the first image as a synchronous placeholder for the second request. Here's what this effect looks like in the sample app: Images in the list have intentionally been loaded with very low detail and the crossfade is slowed down to highlight the visual effect. To achieve this effect, use the MemoryCache.Key of the first request as the ImageRequest.placeholderMemoryCacheKey of the second request. Here's an example: // First request listImageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) // Second request (once the first request finishes) detailImageView . load ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) { placeholderMemoryCacheKey ( listImageView . result . memoryCacheKey ) } Note Previous versions of Coil would attempt to set up this effect automatically . This required executing parts of the image pipeline synchronously on the main thread and it was ultimately removed in version 0.12.0 . Shared Element Transitions \u00b6 Shared element transitions allow you to animate between Activities and Fragments . Here are some recommendations on how to get them to work with Coil: Shared element transitions are incompatible with hardware bitmaps. You should set allowHardware(false) to disable hardware bitmaps for both the ImageView you are animating from and the view you are animating to. If you don't, the transition will throw an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Software rendering doesn't support hardware bitmaps exception. Use the MemoryCache.Key of the start image as the placeholderMemoryCacheKey for the end image. This ensures that the start image is used as the placeholder for the end image, which results in a smooth transition with no white flashes if the image is in the memory cache. Use ChangeImageTransform and ChangeBounds together for optimal results. Remote Views \u00b6 Coil does not provide a Target for RemoteViews out of the box, however you can create one like so: class RemoteViewsTarget ( private val context : Context , private val componentName : ComponentName , private val remoteViews : RemoteViews , @IdRes private val imageViewResId : Int ) : Target { override fun onStart ( placeholder : Drawable?) = setDrawable ( placeholder ) override fun onError ( error : Drawable?) = setDrawable ( error ) override fun onSuccess ( result : Drawable ) = setDrawable ( result ) private fun setDrawable ( drawable : Drawable?) { remoteViews . setImageViewBitmap ( imageViewResId , drawable ?. toBitmap ()) AppWidgetManager . getInstance ( context ). updateAppWidget ( componentName , remoteViews ) } } Then enqueue / execute the request like normal: val request = ImageRequest . Builder ( context ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . target ( RemoteViewsTarget ( context , componentName , remoteViews , imageViewResId )) . build () imageLoader . enqueue ( request ) Transforming Painters \u00b6 Both AsyncImage and AsyncImagePainter have placeholder / error / fallback arguments that accept Painter s. Painters are less flexible than using composables, but are faster as Coil doesn't need to use subcomposition. That said, it may be necessary to inset, stretch, tint, or transform your painter to get the desired UI. To accomplish this, copy this Gist into your project and wrap the painter like so: AsyncImage ( model = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\" , contentDescription = null , placeholder = forwardingPainter ( painter = painterResource ( R . drawable . placeholder ), colorFilter = ColorFilter ( Color . Red ), alpha = 0.5f ) ) The onDraw can be overwritten using a trailing lambda: AsyncImage ( model = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\" , contentDescription = null , placeholder = forwardingPainter ( painterResource ( R . drawable . placeholder )) { info -> inset ( 50f , 50f ) { with ( info . painter ) { draw ( size , info . alpha , info . colorFilter ) } } } )","title":"Recipes"},{"location":"recipes/#recipes","text":"This page provides guidance on how to handle some common use cases with Coil.

This upgrade guide doesn't cover every binary or source incompatible change, but it does cover the most important changes. Minimum API 21 \u00b6 Coil 2.x requires minimum API 21. This is also the minimum API required for Jetpack Compose and OkHttp 4.x. ImageRequest default scale \u00b6 Coil 2.x changes ImageRequest 's default scale from Scale.FILL to Scale.FIT . This was done to ensure be consistent with ImageView 's default ScaleType and Image 's default ContentScale . Scale is still autodetected if you set an ImageView as your ImageRequest.target . Size refactor \u00b6 Size 's width and height is now composed of two Dimension s instead of Int pixel values. Dimension is either a pixel value or Dimension.Original , which represents the source value for that dimension (similar to how Size.ORIGINAL represents the source values for both width and height). You can use the pxOrElse extension to get the pixel value (if present), else use a fallback: val width = size . width . pxOrElse { - 1 } if ( width > 0 ) { // Use the pixel value. } This change was made to improve support for cases where a target has one unbounded dimension (e.g. if one dimension is ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT for a View or Constraints.Infinity in Compose). Jetpack Compose \u00b6 Coil 2.x significantly reworks the Jetpack Compose integration to add features, improve stability, and improve performance. In Coil 1.x you would use rememberImagePainter to load an image: val painter = rememberImagePainter ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) { crossfade ( true ) } Image ( painter = painter , contentDescription = null , contentScale = ContentScale . Crop ) In Coil 2.x rememberImagePainter has been changed to rememberAsyncImagePainter with the following changes: The trailing lambda argument to configure the ImageRequest has been removed. In Coil 2.x, rememberAsyncImagePainter defaults to using ContentScale.Fit to be consistent with Image whereas in Coil 1.x it would default to ContentScale.Crop . As such, if you set a custom ContentScale on Image , you now also need to pass it to rememberAsyncImagePainter . val painter = rememberAsyncImagePainter ( model = ImageRequest . Builder ( LocalContext . current ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . crossfade ( true ) . build (), contentScale = ContentScale . Crop ) Image ( painter = painter , contentDescription = null , contentScale = ContentScale . Crop ) Additionally, Coil now has AsyncImage and SubcomposeAsyncImage composable functions, which add new features and work-around some design limitations of rememberAsyncImagePainter . Check out the full Jetpack Compose docs here . Disk Cache \u00b6 Coil 2.x has its own public disk cache class that can be accessed using imageLoader.diskCache . Coil 1.x relied on OkHttp's disk cache, however it's no longer needed. To configure the disk cache in 1.x you would use CoilUtils.createDefaultCache : ImageLoader . Builder ( context ) . okHttpClient { OkHttpClient . Builder (). cache ( CoilUtils . createDefaultCache ( context )). build () } . build () In Coil 2.x you should not set a Cache object on your OkHttpClient when used with an ImageLoader . Instead configure the disk cache object like so: ImageLoader . Builder ( context ) . diskCache { DiskCache . Builder () . directory ( context . cacheDir . resolve ( \"image_cache\" )) . build () } . build () In Coil 2.x Cache-Control and other cache headers are still supported - except Vary headers, as the cache only checks that the URLs match. Additionally, only responses with a response code in the range [200..300) are cached. When upgrading from Coil 1.x to 2.x, any existing disk cache will be cleared as the internal format has changed. Image pipeline refactor \u00b6 Coil 2.x refactors the image pipeline classes to be more flexible. Here's a high-level list of the changes: Introduce a new class, Keyer , that computes the memory cache key for a request. It replaces Fetcher.key . Mapper , Keyer , Fetcher , and Decoder can return null to delegate to the next element in the list of components. Add Options to Mapper.map 's signature.

Dimension is either a pixel value or Dimension.Original , which represents the source value for that dimension (similar to how Size.ORIGINAL represents the source values for both width and height). You can use the pxOrElse extension to get the pixel value (if present), else use a fallback: val width = size . width . pxOrElse { - 1 } if ( width > 0 ) { // Use the pixel value. } This change was made to improve support for cases where a target has one unbounded dimension (e.g. if one dimension is ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT for a View or Constraints.Infinity in Compose).","title":"Size refactor"},{"location":"upgrading/#jetpack-compose","text":"Coil 2.x significantly reworks the Jetpack Compose integration to add features, improve stability, and improve performance. In Coil 1.x you would use rememberImagePainter to load an image: val painter = rememberImagePainter ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) { crossfade ( true ) } Image ( painter = painter , contentDescription = null , contentScale = ContentScale . Crop ) In Coil 2.x rememberImagePainter has been changed to rememberAsyncImagePainter with the following changes: The trailing lambda argument to configure the ImageRequest has been removed. In Coil 2.x, rememberAsyncImagePainter defaults to using ContentScale.Fit to be consistent with Image whereas in Coil 1.x it would default to ContentScale.Crop . As such, if you set a custom ContentScale on Image , you now also need to pass it to rememberAsyncImagePainter . val painter = rememberAsyncImagePainter ( model = ImageRequest . Builder ( LocalContext . current ) . data ( \"https://www.example.com/image.jpg\" ) . crossfade ( true ) . build (), contentScale = ContentScale .
